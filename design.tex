\section{Design}
In the ideal modeling toolkit, trained machine learning models can be tested alongside dynamical systems formulations of behavioral theory. 
Though greater accuracy may often be achieved using a data-driven model, the theoretical formulation may provide additional insight into the system behavior, and connections to conceptual models can be drawn. 
Enabling easy system configuration allows researchers to leverage the best of all fields, creating a balance between predictive accuracy and model clarity depending on the userâ€™s needs. 
The system configuration must have an intuitive high-level representation, and a highly-detailed interface for defining specifics. 
The user should be given the option to make many modeling assumptions to maximize ease of use, or to make few assumptions to ensure modeling specificity. 
Model re-use and extension must be supported by allowing concepts to operate in interchangeable modules, requiring carefully-defined standards for interface between modules. 
The ideal toolkit also supports model evaluation, comparison, optimization, and exploration to aid the user.
